# smart-gym-mcp

**Talk to your workouts.** An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects AI
assistants like Claude to [SmartGym](https://smartgym.app) on your Mac — so you can review your
training, tweak routines, and build whole programs in plain English, and watch them sync to
your iPhone and Apple Watch.

## Why

SmartGym is a great workout tracker, but building and evolving a training program is still a
lot of tapping. Meanwhile, AI assistants are genuinely good at programming workouts — they just
had no way to reach your data.

This server bridges that gap. Your workout history, routines, and equipment become something
you can have a conversation with:

- *"How has my bench press progressed over the last 3 months?"*
- *"Add face pulls to my pull day, 3×12, after the rows."*
- *"Build me a 3-day full-body comeback program based on what I was lifting in May,
  using only equipment I own."*

Changes land in SmartGym itself — not a parallel app — so your data stays in one place and
syncs everywhere via SmartGym's own engine.

## What it can do

**Read** — health check, list routines, routine details, workout history, your equipment.

**Write** — create complete training programs, add / update / remove / reorder exercises,
rename and edit routines, then publish the edits to your other devices.

**Safely** — the server backs up the database before every write, only writes while the app
is closed (it quits SmartGym itself), and refuses anything it can't do safely. Reads are
strictly read-only.

**Syncing edits (SmartGym 8+)** — SmartGym 8 no longer uploads changes to existing routines
made outside the app, so edits stay on the Mac (with SmartGym left closed) until you call
`smartgym_publish_routines`. Publishing uploads each edited routine as a fresh copy and leaves
an `OLD — <name>` routine on the Mac; archive that one in the SmartGym Mac app and the outdated
copy disappears from your iPhone too. New programs sync on their own.

## Quick start

Requirements: macOS with SmartGym, Python ≥ 3.11, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sla1k/smart-gym-mcp
cd smart-gym-mcp
uv sync
```

Add it to your MCP client — e.g. Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add smartgym -- uv run --directory /path/to/smart-gym-mcp smartgym-mcp
```

or Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smartgym": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/smart-gym-mcp", "smartgym-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your assistant to call `smartgym_health` — `{ ok: true, ... }` means you're connected.

## Configuration

Works out of the box with a standard SmartGym install. Env vars if you need them:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SMARTGYM_DB_PATH` | SmartGym's container path | database location |
| `SMARTGYM_BACKUP_DIR` | `~/.smartgym-mcp/backups` | pre-write backups |

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Design notes live in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md), ideas in
[`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

```sh
uv run pytest                                  # tests never touch your real data
uv run ruff check src tests && uv run mypy src
```
