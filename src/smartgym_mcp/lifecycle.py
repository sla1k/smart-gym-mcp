"""SmartGym app lifecycle: graceful quit + write session + relaunch (spec 03 §C).

The write path quits the app (never kill -9) so direct DB writes cannot race
the live WAL, then relaunches it so the sync engine pushes pending routines
immediately (verified: ~17 s to backend round-trip, Phase 0 spike).

`managed_write` is the ONE orchestration every write tool goes through:
quit → backup+transaction (db.open_rw_connection) → relaunch. Spec 02 tools
must not re-implement this dance.
